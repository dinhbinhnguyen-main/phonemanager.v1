    """
    Execution script to launch the Facebook application on a mobile device.
    
    This function handles the application startup securely by performing a force-stop 
    to ensure a clean cold start, launching the app via package name or deep link, 
    and verifying that the UI reaches the foreground before proceeding.

    Args:
        device_id (str): The unique identifier of the target Android device.
        job (Job): The job entity containing execution parameters such as deep links.
        logger_signal (SignalInstance): PySide6 signal used to transmit logs to the UI.

    Raises:
        Exception: If the application fails to reach the foreground within the timeout 
                  or if a system error occurs during the launch process.
